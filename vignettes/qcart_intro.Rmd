# Introduction
This document shows by example how to use the package `QCART` to track the quality of mass spectrometry experiments in near real time.  This is done using publicly available data that has previously been analyzed by [Amidan et al. (2014)](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr401143e).

#Data

The Amidan et al. data is built into the package and is loaded into your environment with the following (the `QCART` package is also loaded here in case you haven't done that yet).
```{r load}
library(QCART)
data("amidan_et_al")
```
Now there should be a data frame called `amidan` loaded into your environment.
