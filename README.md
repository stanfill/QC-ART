# QC-ART

Functions necessary to implement a dynamic, real-time quality control method for mass spectrometry data.

Currently, the functions in `src/QCArt_functions.R` will implement QC-ART, but it is highly specialized code for the datsets and variables for one specific source of data.  Needs to be generalized.
