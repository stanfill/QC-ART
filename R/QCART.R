#' R implementation of the QC-ART method 
#' 
#' This library consists of two functions: qcart and compute_threshold.  The former computes QC-ART scores given 
#' a dataset, baseline set and variables to use to compute the scores.  The latter uses the computed QC-ART scores 
#' to define threshold values that differentiate the nominal from outlying instrument runs.
